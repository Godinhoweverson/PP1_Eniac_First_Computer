# PP1 ENIAC FIRST COMPUTER

This website is about the history of first computer.

## About

<p align="justify">ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) was the first general-purpose electronic computer. It was designed and built during World War II by John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert of the University of Pennsylvania.
This website provides information about the history and workings of ENIAC.</p>

<p align="justify">By providing information about the Eniac computer, the project can be useful to its target audience in several ways. 

- Firstly, it can provide historical context and background information on the development of computers. This can be particularly useful for students and researchers in computer science and related fields who may want to understand the evolution of computer technology.

- Secondly, the project can help to promote awareness and appreciation of the Eniac computer, which is an important milestone in the history of computing. By making information about the Eniac computer easily accessible, the project can help to ensure that this important part of computing history is not forgotten.

- Finally, the project can serve as a starting point for further research and exploration into the Eniac computer and its impact on the development of computing. The website includes links to additional resources, such as images and videos, which can be useful for those interested in learning more about the Eniac and related topics.</p>

## User Experience (UX)

- The website has a simple and clean design, with a consistent color scheme and typography. The design is not distracting, and it allows the user to focus on the content of the website.

- The website is easy to navigate, with a clear menu at the top of the page that allows the user to quickly access different sections of the website.

- The content of the website is well-organized, with headings and subheadings that make it easy to scan and find specific information. The use of images and videos also helps to break up the text and provide visual interest.

- The website is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices. The text and images scale appropriately, and the website is easy to use on smaller screens.

## Design

### Color scheme

I used <a href="https://coolors.co/000000-545454-ffffff" target="_blank">Coolors.co</a> to generate my colour palette.

### Typography

- <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Fonts</a> were used to import 'Lato', sans-serif into style.css.
- The text on the website is well-justified, which means that it is aligned evenly on both sides, creating a clean and professional appearance.

To follow best practice, wireframes were developed for mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes.
I've used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes) to design my site wireframes.
