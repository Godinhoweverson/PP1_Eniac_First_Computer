     <h2>What was the ENIAC?</h2>
     <p>The ENIAC, or Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer, was the result of 
        a U.S. government-funded project during World War II to build an electronic computer that could be programmed.
         The project was based out of the University of Pennsylvania's Moore School of Engineering. The design team included 
         engineer J. Presper Eckert Jr. and physicist John Mauchly under the leadership of Herman Goldstine. The team began work 
         on the project in 1943. John von Neumann, a noted mathematician of the day, began consulting on the project in 1944.</p>

        <h2>How Did the ENIAC Work?</h2>
        <p>
            Unlike the computers of the present day, the ENIAC was designed with one specific goal. It was programmed to compute the values of artillery range tables.
